* Introduction
I started to use Emacs about a month ago instead of MS Visual Studia 2010 and couple of other text editors.
In this file I would like to describe various problems I encountered and its solutions.
It looks like that Emacs Org mode is quite convinient to keep notes of such kind.
So let start

-  cs mode
-  tfs integration
-  spell check
-  
-  add line highlight in dired


* Problems

** spell check
I need spell check my writings including this file and also comments in my code.
Is integration with After the Deadline possible?

** .Net code editing
Inspite of working mainly with JavaScript I sometimes edit C# and aspx,
so it would be great to get at least code coloring for them.

** TFS integration
Microsoft Team Foundation server (TFS) has terrible version control system desendant of VSS.
Required a way to do simple operation like file check out from Emacs

** Highlight current line in Dired


* Solution
